- 👋 Hi, I’m @tamarawalker
- 👀 I’m interested in acquiring certifications in business analysis and project management.  I'm also interested in learning new coding tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about project management and will soon start working in Visual Studio after a long absence.  I get to relearn that tool.  (Exciting)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on scripting, coding, sql and automation.
- 📫 How to reach me through email tamwalker@communicare-advantage.com
